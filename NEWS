0.5.2
=====

Changes since 0.5.1:

- Add a missing NULL check.
- Fix a potential leak of xmlDoc.
- Register a (g)type for GUPnPSearchCriteriaOp for better gtk-doc and
  vala-gen-introspect support.
- Fix docs for GUPnPSearchCriteriaParser::expression.
- Fix parsing of SearchCriteria strings: Closing parenthesis doesn't imply end
  of SearchCriteria expression.

0.5.1
=====

A micro release to fix a regression in DLNA profile guessing code in the
previous (0.5) release.

===

Changes in this release:

- New completely object-oriented, much simpler and consistent API:
  * GUPnPDIDLLiteResource & GUPnPDIDLLiteObject are now first-class GObjects.
  * Convert the helper methods to read props and their attributes from DIDL-Lite
    xml node into new first-class objects with writable properties:
    - GUPnPDIDLLiteObject
    - GUPnPDIDLLiteItem
    - GUPnPDIDLLiteContainer
  * GUPnPDIDLLiteObject provides a convenient method to get the compatible
    resource given a SinkProtocolInfo string.
  * A new class for dealing with protocolInfo fields: GUPnPProtocolInfo.
  * A new class for dealing with DIDL-Lite descriptors: GUPnPDIDLLiteDescriptor.
  * GUPnPDIDLLiteWriter now provides a much simpler API that is consistent with
    rest of the GUPnP AV API.
  * GUPnPDIDLLiteWriter now handles filtering of DIDL-Lite XML.
  * Correct possible values of GUPnPDLNAFlags.
  * Replace GUPnPDIDLLiteParserObjectCallback by following signals:
    - object-available
    - container-available
    - item-available
- New Error domain for protocol related errors.
- Workaround for broken printf() implementations.
- Bitrate is in bytes/second and not bits/second.
- Enable DLL on windows.

Dependencies changed:

- gupnp >= 0.13

Bug fixes in this release:

1729 - bitrate checks in gupnp-dlna.c look wrong.
1579 - Minor fixes to enable dynamic library on windows

0.4.1
=====

Changes in this release:

- Fix typos in allowed frequencies.
- Fix allowed frequencies in AC-3 and LPCM profiles.
- Fix pkg-config paths.
- Don't set the variable if it's value is not provided in the LastChange event.

Bug fixes in this release:

1563 - typos in allowed frequencies for DLNA profiles
1570 - gupnp doesn't set the pkgconfig lib dir correctly in 64 bit env

- Watch for empty DIDL-Lite nodes.
- Escape the URIs before putting them into DIDL-Lite XML.
- The '.' must be omitted from duration if fraction part is not included.
- Be more lenient when parsing DIDL-Lite XML fragments.
- Don't require the DLNA profile string.
- Try to guess the DLNA Profile if not provided and put "*" in the whole 4th
  field of protocolInfo if our guess work fails.
- Make sure 4th field of protocolInfo is completely in compliance with DLNA
  guidelines. This only implies one change in the API: enum dlna_play_speed is
  replaced by play_speeds, a GList of allowed play speeds as strings.
- Use '1' and '0' to express boolean properties in DIDL-Lite XML.
- Other minor fixes.
